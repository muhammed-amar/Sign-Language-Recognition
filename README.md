# Sign Language Recognition System

## 🎯 Overview

A comprehensive sign language recognition system using artificial intelligence and image processing techniques. The system enables real-time conversion of hand gestures into text, making communication more accessible and efficient.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔄 Real-time video processing and gesture recognition
- 🤖 High accuracy in sign language interpretation
- 🌐 RESTful API with FastAPI backend
- 📱 Simple and intuitive user interface
- 🚀 High performance and low latency
- 🔍 Advanced image processing capabilities
- 📊 Real-time feedback and performance metrics

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV for image processing
- FastAPI for backend services
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Webcam for video input
- Modern web browser for client interface

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-recognition.git
cd sign-language-recognition
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
python app.py
```

4. Run the client:
```bash
python client.py
```
